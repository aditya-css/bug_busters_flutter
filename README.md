## Project Idea:

To get the developers touch the kind nature of theirs and take time from their tight schedule, we have come up with an idea that would work as a way of motivation for developers and perhaps bring their dreams a little closer. Introducing a geeky reward for the ultimate geeks, the one and only cryptocurrency. Our solution is to provide a platform where people can ask questions and get all the answers just as the basic need of a community but with the ability for someone, when feeling grateful enough, to gift - the promised geeky gift - cryptocurrency to that kind user.
